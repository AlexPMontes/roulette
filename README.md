# roulette
### A bash scripting based tool to proove different casino roulette techniques.  
With this tool you can try the most famous roulette techniques (such as martingala) to see their viability and if you can become rich using them (SPOILER: no).

## How does it works?
It is so simple. First of all you have to download this tool in your linux device (if you use Windows what are you doing lol ðŸ¤£).  

When you have it you have to decide how much money are you going to bet, and what technique do you want to try, whit something like this:  
```bash
./roulette.sh -m [initial_money] -t [technique]
```
And that's it!! You'll have to introduce the objective of money that you want to earn and you will see with your own eyes if you get it or not.  

**Note:** right now the only technique is martingala, at the future more techniques will be added.

I have to say that the idea of this project comes from the Linux course from Hack4u, created by @s4vitar, I give the link right here: https://hack4u.io/.  
Really enjoying the course and I need to thank s4vitar for the quality of the course and recommend the course to all the people who wants to learn cybersecurity. **Se tensÃ³**
